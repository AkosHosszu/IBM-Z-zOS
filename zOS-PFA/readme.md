This repository contains example code showing how to graph data collected by Predictive Failure Analysis(PFA). These graphs can be instrumental in getting to the root cause of exceptions issued by PFA. For detailed instructions on how to use this example code see Chapter 10: Graphing Exhaustion Data in z/OS Problem Management or carefully look over the comments in the code. These example programs require Python3 with the numpy, matplotlib, and pandas modules.
