What is a z/OS Archetype?
=========================
A z/OS Archetype is an [archetype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype) that has been defined for tasks related to z/OS.  More specifically, z/OS Archetypes
are roles that are commonly found associated with the z/OS platform, although these tasks might even involve other platforms.  The responsiblities of the z/OS Archetypes
