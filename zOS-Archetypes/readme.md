What is a z/OS Archetype?
=========================
A "z/OS Archetype" defines a fundamental role that is commonly associated with the z/OS computing platform. It can be a useful way to identify a class of users who share a set of z/OS skills and responsibilities. Various and many z/OS Archetypes exist; each plays a part in making z/OS a world-class operating system.

In an actual z/OS environment, the delineations between performers can be blurred. One person might be expected to perform tasks that are associated with several of the z/OS Archetypes defined here. Or, the responsibilities of a single z/OS Archetype might be spread among a team of performers. 

A key point is that the grouping of the tasks within a z/OS Archetype is generally associated with a skill or domain of knowledge. For example, the z/OS System Programmer archetype is sometimes fulfilled by a large team of people, each of whom might be responsible for performing related system programming tasks, such as installation, configuration, or software maintenance. Further, the responsibilties of a z/OS Archetype might extend to performing related tasks on other computing platforms, too.
