		<title>Upgrade to an IBM z15 server</title>  
		<description><![CDATA[  
			<h4>Description</h4>  
			<p>
			With the new IBM® z15™ (z15™) server as the infrastructure, your business has the power to optimize 
			digital services delivery, accelerate business innovation, and ultimately improve the bottom line. 
			The z15 can help you adapt to planned or unplanned events while keeping services and operations 
			running smoothly and continuously, on premises or in the cloud.</p>  
			<p>
			The z15 ™ uses a 19-inch form factor and industry-standardized power and networking hardware. 
			The system is configurable as a one-to-four 19-inch frame system, which easily aligns with the 
			modern cloud data center.</p>
			<p>
			The IBM z15 Model T02 (z15 T02) is the newest addition to the IBM z15 family. The z15 T02 is designed 
			for clients who do not need the capacity of the larger T01	models.</p>
			<p>
			The IBM z15 family of mainframes includes the following hardware models: 
			<ul>
				<li>
				Model T01 (machine type 8561), with five feature codes to represent the processor capacity. 
				The feature codes are Max34, Max71, Max108, Max145, and Max190 with (respectively) 34, 71, 108, 
				145, and 190. This system is configurable as a one-to-four 19-inch frame system.</li>
				<li>
				Model T02 (machine type 8562), with five CPC size features (one or two drawers). 
				The system is configurable as a 19-inch frame system.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			In this workflow, references to "z15" pertain to all models of the IBM z15, 
			including the z15 T02, unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p>
			z/OS base support for specific z15 functions depends on the z/OS release. 
			Not all z15™ functions are available in every z/OS release, as shown in the tables: 
			<ul>
			<li>Table 1 lists the z15 functions and indicates whether each function is included in a specific 
			z/OS release (Yes or No), or whether the function requires a PTF (PTF) or a web deliverable (Web). 
			For information about z/OS V2R1 support, see the <em>Table Notes</em>.
			Information about finding the appropriate PTFs is provided in the workflow step	"Actions you can take 
			before you order an IBM z15 server" and its substeps. </li>
			<li>Table 2 shows a summary view of which z15 functions are available for exploitation in each z/OS release.
			Some functions have upgrade or exploitation considerations. Information about the applicable 
			upgrade actions is provided in the steps and substeps for "Actions you can take before you order an 
			IBM z15 server" and "Actions you can take after installing an IBM z15 server."</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			Many functions are enabled or disabled, based on the presence or absence of the required hardware and software. 
			If you plan to use new z15 functions, you can install the software and hardware in either order. 
			That is, there is no requirement to install either software or hardware first to use a specific function. 
			However, because of outage windows and testing considerations, you might want to consider installing all of 
			the software and PTFs required for the machine and the functions you plan to use first. 
			Then, upgrade the hardware and, finally, update your customization to use the new functions.</p> 
			</p>

			<title>Support is delivered by service, z/OS features, and web deliverables</title>  
			<description><![CDATA[  
				<h6>Description</h6>  
				<p>
				The base support for the z15™ is delivered through service (PTFs). To determine which PTFs are required, 
				obtain the current enhanced HOLDDATA file, either by using the SMP/E RECEIVE ORDER command or by downloading 
				the 2-year file and using the SMP/E RECEIVE command to process it.</p>
				<p>
				Then, use the SMP/E REPORT MISSINGFIX command to identify the missing PTFs on your system for the IBM z15. 
				For example:</p>  
				<pre>
				SET BDY(GLOBAL).
				REPORT MISSINGFIX ZONES( target_zone)
				FIXCAT(IBM.Device.Server.z15*.**).
				</pre>  
				<p>
				The following SMP/E FIXCATs identify the PTF support for the IBM z15:
				<ul>
				<li>For the IBM z15 Model T01 server: 
				   <ul>
				      <li>FIXCAT for required service is: <code>IBM.Device.Server.z15-8561.RequiredService</code></li>
				      <li>FIXCAT for recommended service is: <code>IBM.Device.Server.z15-8561.RecommendedService</code></li>
				      <li>FIXCAT for exploitation is: <code>IBM.Device.Server.z15-8561.Exploitation</code></li>
				   </ul>
				<li>For the IBM z15 Model T02 server:
				   <ul>
				      <li>FIXCAT for required service is: <code>IBM.Device.Server.z15T02-8562.RequiredService</code></li>
				      <li>FIXCAT for recommended service is: <code>IBM.Device.Server.z15T02-8562.RecommendedService</code></li>
				      <li>FIXCAT for exploitation service is: <code>IBM.Device.Server.z15T02-8562.Exploitation</code></li>
				   </ul>
				</ul>
				<p>
				The RequiredService FIXCATs identify the minimum PTFs that are required to use  z/OS on the z15 --- you must install these PTFs. 
				The RecommendedService FIXCATs group the PTFs that the IBM Service organization recommends that you install. 
				The Exploitation FIXCATs include the new functions that are provided on the z15, which  you can choose to exploit.</p>
				<p>
				The Preventive Service Planning (PSP) buckets for the z15 servers are identified by an upgrade name and one or more subset names, as follows:
				<ul>
				<li>For the IBM z15 Model T01 server, the PSP Upgrade name is <codeph>8561DEVICE</codeph>, 
				and the z/OS support can be found in Subset <codeph>8561/ZOS</codeph>.</li>
				<li>For the IBM z15 Model T02 server, the PSP Upgrade name is <codeph>8562DEVICE</codeph>, 
				and the z/OS support can be found in Subset <codeph>8562/ZOS</codeph>.</li></ul>
				</p>
				</p>
				<p>Exploitation of some functions requires a web deliverable. Specifically:</p>  
				<ul> 
					<li>Exploitation of Crypto Express7S requires the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V2R2 - z/OS V2R4 (FMID HCR77D1) web deliverable. 
						<p>If you are using this web deliverable and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs identified by the following fix category:
							<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V2R2-V2R4-HCR77D1</code> 
						</p> 
					</li>  
					<li>If you are running z/OS V2R1 and require Crypto Express6S exploitation support for the next Generation Coprocessor support or VISA Format Preserving Encryption (FPE), you must download and install the Enhanced Cryptographic Support for z/OS V2R1-z/OS V2R3 web deliverable (FMID HCR77C0) or the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V2R1 - z/OS V2R3 web deliverable (HCR77C1). 
						<p>If you are using either of these web deliverables (HCR77C0 or HCR77C1) and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs identified by the appropriate fix category: 
							<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V2R1-z/OS_V2R3-HCR77C0</code> or 
							<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V2R1-z/OS_V2R3-HCR77C1</code>.
						</p> 
					</li>  
					<li>If you are running z/OS V2R1 and require Crypto Express5S exploitation support for the next Generation Coprocessor support or VISA Format Preserving Encryption (FPE), you must download and install the Enhanced Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77B0) or the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13 - z/OS V2R2 web deliverable (HCR77B1). 
						<p>If you are using either of these web deliverables (HCR77B0 or HCR77B1) and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs identified by the appropriate fix category:
							<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77B0</code> or 
							<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77B1</code>.
						</p> 
					</li>  
					<li>To run z/OS V2R1 on a z15™ server, you require IBM Software Support Services for extended z/OS V2R1 support.</li>

				<p>When you change the coupling facility control code level (CFLEVEL), your coupling facility structure sizes 
				might change.</p>
				<p> 
				If, as part of your upgrade to a z15™ server, you change the CFLEVEL, you might have larger structure sizes 
				than you did previously. If your CFLEVEL is identical, structure sizes are not expected to change when you 
				upgrade from a previous server to a newer generation server.</p> 
				<p>
				In addition, similar to CFLEVEL 17 and later, ensure that the CF LPAR has at least 512MB of storage. 
				CFLEVEL 24, introduced on the z15, supports the Coupling Facility use of Large Memory to improve availability 
				for larger CF cache structures and data sharing performance with larger DB2 Group Buffer Pools (GBP). 
				This support removes inhibitors to using large CF cache structures, enabling use of Large Memory to 
				scale to larger DB2 Local Buffer Pools (LBP) and Group Buffer Pools (GBP) in data sharing environments.</p>

			<title>z15 servers in a sysplex</title>  
			<description><![CDATA[  
				<h6>Description</h6>  
				<p>Be aware of the following considerations:
				<ul> 
					<li>
					A Parallel Sysplex® that contains a z15™ server, either for a z/OS image or a coupling facility (CF) image, 
					can contain only z13 or later servers.</li>
					<li>
					The z15 requires ICA-SR and CE-LR fanouts. The older HCA3-O or the HCA3-O LR coupling fanouts are 
					not supported on the z15 server.
					</li>
					<li>
					Servers such as the z14, z14 ZR1, z13, or z13s, can connect to the z15 by using the Integrated Coupling Adapter 
					Short Reach (ICA SR) and the Coupling Express Long Reach (CE LR) coupling links. Earlier systems, such as the zEC12 
					and zBC12, do not support ICA SR or CE LR, and therefore cannot have coupling link connectivity to the z15 server.
					</li>
					<li>
					If you are running z/OS on any servers earlier than a z13 or z13s, you cannot add a z15 to that sysplex; 
					that is, you will not be able to perform rolling IPLs to introduce a z15 server if you have any of the earlier 
					servers as z/OS images or coupling facility images in the sysplex.
					</li>
					<li>The earlier servers in the sysplex must be upgraded to z13 or z13s or later to have z15™ servers supported 
					in the sysplex. If you have any z/OS images or coupling facility images on an earlier server, and you intend to 
					introduce a z15 server into that sysplex, you must move those images to a z13 or z13s or later server before 
					introducing the z15 server.
					</li>
					<li>
					GRS supports the use of FICON CTCs for Ring configurations. However, if you are currently using ESCON CTCs 
					for GRS ring configurations within a sysplex, consider converting to GRS Star if possible, or using XCF signaling 
					in a GRS ring configuration. XCF sysplex signaling is preferred instead of GRS CTC connections.
					</li>
					<li>
					IBM Z® servers that require time synchronization (for example, to support a base or Parallel Sysplex) must be 
					configured in Server Time Protocol (STP) mode. STP is designed to allow multiple servers and coupling facilities 
					to maintain time synchronization with each other, in a coordinated timing network (CTN). STP is a hardware feature 
					of the z15, z14, z14 ZR1, z13, z13s, zEC12, and zBC12. The most recent servers (z15, z14, z14 ZR1, z13, and z13s) 
					can participate only in an STP-only CTN.
					</li>
					<li>
					Starting with IBM z15, the IBM Z Hardware Management Appliance (FC #0100) can be ordered to provide HMC/SE 
					functions within the CPC frame, eliminating the need for separate HMCs outside of the frame.
					</li>

							<li>For high-speed short-range coupling connectivity, the IBM Integrated Coupling Adapter (ICA SR) is a two-port, short-distance coupling fanout that uses a new coupling channel type: CS5. The ICA SR can only be used for coupling connectivity between z15, z14, z14 ZR1, z13, and z13s servers. The ICA SR fanout requires new cabling, and can connect only to another ICA SR.</li>  
							<li>For long-range coupling connectivity, the Coupling Express® Long Reach (CE LR) is a two-port, long-distance coupling adapter that uses a new coupling channel type: CL5. The CE LR can be used only for coupling connectivity between z15, z14, z14 ZR1, z13, and z13s servers.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>The suggested practice is to order ICA SR (#0172) or CE LR (#0433) on the z15™ servers that are used in a Parallel Sysplex to help ensure coupling compatibility with future server generations.</p> 
					</li>  
					<li>CHPID type OSN (OSA-Express for NCP) is not supported on the OSA-Express5S GbE LX feature</li>  
					<li>OSA-Express4S features</li>  
					<li>Crypto Express3 and Crypto Express4S</li>  
					<li>InterSystem Channel-3 (ISC-3) coupling links feature</li>  
					<li>FICON Express4</li>  
					<li>zEDC Express (FC #0420). In the z15, the compression functions are moved into the processor chip, 
					which is referred to as IBM Integrated Accelerator for z Enterprise Data Compression (zEDC). 
					As an integrated part of the z15™ processor chip, the Integrated Accelerator for zEDC does not require 
					the purchase of a hardware feature or usage of I/O slots.</li>  
					<li>IBM Flash Express (features #0402 and #0403), which is replaced by IBM Virtual Flash Memory (VFM), starting with the z14. VFM implements Extended Asynchronous Data Mover (EADM) Architecture that uses HSA-like memory instead of Flash card pairs. No application changes are required to change from IBM Flash Express to VFM.</li>  
					<li>As of HMC version 2.15.0, new builds of the Hardware Master Console (HMC) and the Support Element (SE) no longer include a CD/DVD drive as part the HMC server hardware. Instead, the HMC provides two options for installing functional updates: USB media and electronic delivery. These solutions are available for: 
						<ul> 
							<li>Firmware for the HMC or Support Element</li>  
							<li>eBusiness on Demand (eBoD) records, such as On/Off Capacity on Demand (On/Off CoD)</li>  
							<li>Operating system code, as used for 
								<strong>Load from Removable Media</strong> or the Server task.
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>If you select to use USB media, the appropriate USB Flash Memory Drive Media is provided with the particular feature, using either of the following feature codes:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li><b>Feature code 0843:</b> USB Load media that can be used for IBM Z operating system code</li>
							<li><b>Feature code 0848:</b> USB Backup media that can be used for an HMC or SE Critical Data Backup task.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>If USB media is not acceptable for your environment, choose electronic delivery instead. 
						Order feature code 0846 (No Physical Media Option) and follow the instructions on how to electronically deliver 
						the required content over the network by using any of the following options:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Z Remote Support Facility (zRSF)</li>  
							<li>IBM Resource Link</li>  
							<li>FTP/SFTP/FTPS Server connections from the HMC.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>For an electronic only delivery environment, two HMCs are required on every unique network subnet on which an HMC, SE, or TKE 
						workstation is connected.</p> 
					</li> 
				</ul>

			<description><![CDATA[  
				<h6>Description</h6>  
				<p>IBM recommends that you use the SMP/E REPORT MISSINGFIX command to identify PTFs for the z15™ server that you 
				do not already have installed. To do so, specify <code>IBM.Device.Server.*</code> and 
				<code>IBM.Function.*</code> as the fix categories for the REPORT MISSINGFIX command. 
					This command identifies not only the z15™ support PTFs, but also the PTFs for prior generations of IBM servers 
					that you might need, and those required to enable various functions. 
					Also, REPORT MISSINGFIX creates a batch job for the SMP/E RECEIVE ORDER command that you can use to 
					get any PTFs you do not already have. SMP/E also provides an Explorer function that you can use to find 
					new fix categories that might be of interest.
					</p>
					<p> 
					For descriptions of the fix categories, see the Values and Descriptions page at
					<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/smpe/fix-category.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IBM Fix Category Values and Descriptions</a>. 
					For more information about the REPORT MISSINGFIX command, see
					<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.gim1000/abstract.htm">z/OS SMP/E Commands</a>.
				</p>  
				<p>Here is an example of the SMP/E control statements you can use for REPORT MISSINGFIX:</p>  
				<pre>
				SET BDY(GLOBAL).
                REPORT MISSINGFIX ZONES( target zone)
                FIXCAT(IBM.Device.Server.**, IBM.Function.*).
                </pre>  
				<p>If you want to use specific fix categories, you can specify the following fix categories either individually or together 
				for the z/OS PTFs that are required to use a z15™ server, exploit its functions and features, and those that IBM recommends 
				that you install if you are using a z15™ server. Also needed are the fix categories for intermediate servers.</p> 
				<p>
				<ul>
				<li>For the IBM z15 Model T01: 
				<ul>
					<li><code>IBM.Device.Server.z15-8561.RequiredService</code></li>
					<li><code>IBM.Device.Server.z15-8561.Exploitation</code></li>
					<li><code>IBM.Device.Server.z15-8561.RecommendedService</code></li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>For the IBM z15 Model T02: 
				<ul>
				<li><code>IBM.Device.Server.z15T02-8562.RequiredService</code></li>
				<li><code>IBM.Device.Server.z15T02-8562.Exploitation</code></li>
				<li><code>IBM.Device.Server.z15T02-8562.RecommendedService</code></li>
				</ul></li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
				If you are exploiting z15™ capabilities by installing a web deliverable, more PTFs might be required. 
				Follow the instructions in the Program Directory that is associated with each web deliverable to identify 
				the required PTFs.</p>  
				<p>
					If you choose not to use the Recommended Service fix category for your z15 server, 
					you can, alternatively, find lists of the recommended PTFs in the Preventive Service Planning (PSP) 
					“buckets” for the applicable hardware and software. 
					However, note that using PSP buckets and checking the status of the PTFs listed in them is more 
					time-consuming and potentially error-prone than using REPORT MISSINGFIX with the appropriate fix category: 
					<ul>
						<li>For the IBM z15 Model T01, the PSP Upgrade name is <code>8561DEVICE</code>, and the z/OS 
						support can be found in Subset <code>8561/ZOS</code>.</li>
						<li>For the IBM z15 Model T02, the PSP Upgrade name is <code>8562DEVICE</code>, and the z/OS 
						support can be found in Subset <code>8562/ZOS</code>.</li>
					</ul>

			<title>Prepare for the new machine instruction mnemonics</title>  
			<description><![CDATA[  
				<h6>Description</h6>  
				<p>The instruction set has been expanded on the z15™ server, as is usual for new servers. 
				Each machine instruction is represented by a mnemonic in Assembler language. It is possible that the 
				new mnemonics can match names that you chose for Assembler macro instructions. 
				If such naming collisions occur, the Assembler default opcode table (UNI) processes new mnemonics as instructions, 
				not as macros, after z15™ required service is installed. 
				If this occurs, it is likely to cause Assembler error messages and can cause incorrect object code to be generated. 
				If you write programs in Assembler Language, compare the names of your existing Assembler macro instructions 
				to the new machine instructions, to identify any such conflicts or collisions that would occur. 
				The Assembler macro instructions are documented in 
				<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg2b9de5f05a9d57819852571c500428f9a" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">z/Architecture Principles of Operation</a>.
				For information about a tool to help in identifying mnemonic conflicts, see the IBM Techdocs web site under 
				<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/Web/Presentations" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">Presentations and Tools</a>. 
				Search for the Techdoc <q>PRS5289</q>.
				</p>  
				<p>If a conflict is identified, take one of these actions:</p>  
				<ul> 
					<li>Change the name of your macro instruction.</li>  
					<li>Specify PARM='...OPTABLE(YOP)...' (or some other earlier opcode table).</li>  
					<li>Specify a separate ASMAOPT file containing assembler options such as in the previous method (this method requires no changes to source code or JCL).</li>  
					<li>Add as the first statement of your source program: *PROCESS OPTABLE(YOP) (or some other earlier opcode table).</li>  
					<li>Specify the PROFILE option either in JCL or the ASMAOPT file, and the specified or default member of the SYSLIB data set is copied into the front of the source program.</li>  
					<li>If you must use both a new instruction and a macro with the same name in an assembly, 
					use a coding technique that allows the use of a new instruction and a macro with 
					the same name in an assembly, such as HLASM mnemonic tags ( 
						<code>:MAC</code>  
						<code>:ASM</code>).
					</li> 
				</ul> 
				<p>To help you associate the OPTABLE levels with IBM Z processor generations:
				<ul>
				<li>HLASM APAR PH03536 defines OPTABLE names Z9 through Z14 as synonyms for 
				ZS3 through ZS8.</li>
				<li>HLASM APAR PH00902 adds OPTABLE name Z15 and synonym ZS9.</li>
				</ul></p>
				<p>Similarly, HLASM APAR PH00902 extends the MACHINE option to support various 
				other names, based on short forms of the IBM machine name, such as zEC12 and z990. 
				This APAR adds support for values in the form ARCH-n, to select the table that 
				most closely corresponds to the ARCH(n) option in IBM compilers for 
				C, COBOL, and PL/I. For example, both MACHINE(z15) and MACHINE(ARCH-13) are 
				supported with the installation of HLASM APAR PH00902.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[  
				<h6>Description</h6>  
				<p>In HiperDispatch processing, changes in LPAR weight can cause I/O enabled vertical-high (Vh) and vertical-medium (Vm) 
				processors to be converted to vertical-low (Vl) processors, and immediately parked by HiperDispatch. 
				That is, the Vh and Vm processors can be pushed to the lowest configured online processors.</p>  
				<p>Starting with z/OS V2R4, the system resources manager (SRM) component of z/OS reverses the search direction 
				that is used to find processors for I/O enablement. SRM enables processors for I/O interrupts from the lowest 
				configured CPU ID to the highest configured CPU ID. This enhancement keeps Vh or Vm processors enabled for I/O 
				interrupts after processor topology changes.</p>  
				<p>The HiperDispatch enhancement is included in the z/OS V2R4 base. It can be added to z/OS V2R2 and z/OS V2R3 
				by installing the PTF for APAR OA55935. 
				It is identified by the following SMP/E fix categories: 
					<ul>
						<li>For the IBM z15 Model T01, use fix category <code>IBM.Device.Server.z15-8561.Exploitation</code></li>
						<li>For the IBM z15 Model T02, use fix category <code>IBM.Device.Server.z15T02-8562.Exploitation</code></li>

				<p>The z15™ supports the new levels ARCH(13) and TUNE(13), which are needed to take advantage of most of the

				<p>It is recommended that you upgrade to the IBM z/OS XL C/C++ V2.4.1 web deliverable for IBM z/OS 
				V2.4, which became available on December 13, 2019. This new compiler supports the C11, C++11, and C++14

				technology in the IBM XL compilers to exploit the latest z/Architecture, including the IBM z15. 
				The z/OS XL C/C++ V2.4.1 compiler supports English messages and EBCDIC and ASCII execution character sets, 
				and generates AMODE 64 code, making it ideal for z/OS UNIX users who are porting applications from

			<title>Upgrade actions for IBM Integrated Accelerator for z Enterprise Data Compression (zEDC)</title>  
			<description><![CDATA[  
				<h6>Description</h6>  
				<p>
				In the z15, the compression functions are moved into the processor chip, which is referred to as 
				IBM Integrated Accelerator for z Enterprise Data Compression (zEDC). IBM Integrated Accelerator for 
				zEDC replaces zEDC Express (FC #0420). IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC uses industry standard 
				compression formats for file compression that can enable reduction in the size of data, which can 
				save storage space and increase data transfer rates. The z/OS APIs, both authorized and zlib, 
				transparently enable all existing software exploitation on z15, 
				which was already enabled on z14 and earlier with zEDC Express. 
				Support is available on z/OS V2R1, z/OS V2R2, z/OS V2R3, and z/OS V2R4 when running on z15. 
				No toleration support is required.</p>  
				<p>
				Data that is compressed with zEDC Express can be decompressed with IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC. 
				The software inflate routine is updated to be RFC-compliant. 
				This change allows for fallback so that IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC compressed data can be decompressed 
				on z14 and earlier servers.</p>  
				<p>As with zEDC Express, IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC compression supports two types of processing:</p>  
				<ul> 
					<li>Synchronous processing in problem state, which is requested through the zlib data compression library services</li>  
					<li>Asynchronous processing in authorized state, which is requested through the IBM Z authorized compression services.</li> 
				</ul>  
				<p>
				As was done previously for zEDC, parmlib member IFAPRDxx is used to enable compression. 
				However, with IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC compression on the z15, 
				you use IFAPRDxx only for enabling asynchronous processing. 
				It is not required for zlib-based (problem state) uses.</p>  
				<p>
				The following example shows a typical IFAPRDxx entry for IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC compression, 
				which uses the same format as the zEDC Express. If your IFAPRDxx member already contains this entry, 
				you can retain it on the z15.</p>  
				<pre>
				<code>PRODUCT OWNER('IBM CORP')
				NAME('Z/OS')
				FEATURENAME('ZEDC')
				ID(5650-ZOS)
				VERSION(*)
				RELEASE(*)
				MOD(*)
				STATE(ENABLED)</code>
				</pre>  
				<p>
				Before upgrading to the z15, you must install the z/OS zlib PTFs for this support, 
				which are identified by the following SMP/E fix categories: 
			    <ul>
				<li>For the IBM z15 Model T01, use fix category <code>IBM.Device.Server.z15-8561.RequiredService</code></li>
				<li>For the IBM z15 Model T02, use fix category <code>IBM.Device.Server.z15T02-8562.RequiredService</code></li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Also, you must apply the PTF for APAR OA56143.</p>
				<p>
				Then, relink your applications with the updated zlib data compression library. 
				If the PTFs are not installed, z/OS attempts to find a zEDC device, which is not supported on the z15. 
				If so, no compression or decompression can occur.</p>
				<p>
				The IBM Z Batch Network Analyzer (zBNA) tool is updated to provide usage estimation for 
				IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC compression.</p>
				<p> 
				For more information about the zBNA tool, see IBM Techdoc PRS5132 at
				<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/PRS5132" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IBM Z Batch Network Analyzer (zBNA) Tool</a>. 
				</p>
				<p>
				In the future, after you have upgraded all servers to the z15™ level (including servers that 
				are used for disaster recovery), and you have installed the related PTFs on all of your z/OS systems, 
				you might have the following clean-up actions to perform:  
				<ul> 
				<li>
				In parmlib member IQPPRMxx, the MAXSEGMENTS option is obsolete and therefore ignored. 
				Also, the defaults for DEFMINREQSIZE and INFMINREQSIZE are changed and those values 
				can no longer be updated through parmlib. You can remove these settings from your 
				IQPPRMxx parmlib member.</li>
				<li>
				Applications that use zlib no longer require READ access to SAF resource 
				<code>FPZ.ACCELERATOR.COMPRESSION</code> in the FACILITY CLASS.
				You can remove these application authorizations from your external security manager, 
				such as RACF</li>
				</ul></p>

			<description><![CDATA[  
				<h6>Description</h6>  
				<p>
				New for the z15, this enhancement can provide faster operating system IPL, middleware and workload 
				restart and recovery, and planned shutdown. During a boost period that applies during operating system 
				shutdown and following a reIPL or restart, the IBM z15™ can make additional processing capacity 
				available to the system in a variety of ways to help accelerate processing, and apply that same 
				boosted capacity to improve workload throughput and response time and elapsed time during the boost. 
				Enhancements in Geographically Dispersed Parallel Sysplex (GDPS) automation are also designed to 
				provide faster, more efficient, and more highly-parallel orchestration of GDPS automated 
				reconfiguration activities, such as activating or deactivating images, IPLing images, and so on.</p>  
				<p>
				System Recovery Boost works by providing additional processor capacity and parallelism during a 
				boost period, using your installation's already-entitled CPUs and zIIPs. 
				System Recovery Boost does this without increasing the four-hour rolling average (4HRA) 
				IBM software billing cost or MSU consumption associated with your workload during this time.</p>
				<p>
				<b>Note:</b> The IBM z15 Model T02 does not provide the System Recovery Boost Upgrade 
				capability to add additional "temporary capacity" zIIP processors. Thus, the z15 Model T02 
				does not offer System Recovery Boost Upgrade Feature Codes 9930 and 6802.</p>
				<p>
				For more information about System Recovery Boost, see the following books: 
				<ul>
				<li><cite>IBM z15 Technical Introduction</cite>, SG24-8850</li>
				<li><cite>IBM Z Capacity on Demand User's Guide</cite>, SC28-6985-03</li>
